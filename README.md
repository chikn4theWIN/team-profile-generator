# Team Profile Generator 

## Description 

This application is used to create a team profile based on the user's input using Inquirer module from Node.js. It displays the information onto a dynamically generated HTML that directly pushes to the web application. In development, we used OOP and TTD to ensure the project was made to last. We used Jest for the testing. Enjoy!
